### 2. **Instructional Content** ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 3. **Presentation Cards**

### 4. **Current Pain Points & Opportunities**

#### **A. Information Overload**
**Issue**: Spectators see judge-focused information that may not be relevant
- Judge scores with complex 25-point scale
- Technical progress bars and voting statistics
- Multiple scoring metrics that spectators don't directly influence

**Impact**: May confuse spectators about their role and what they should focus on

#### **B. Unclear Value Proposition**
**Issue**: Spectators may not understand the importance of their participation
- Limited explanation of how spectator likes are used
- No visibility into aggregate spectator feedback
- Unclear relationship between spectator likes and overall evaluation

#### **C. Inconsistent Visual Emphasis**
**Issue**: Like button competes visually with other elements
- Reserve button has similar visual weight as Like button
- Judge scores dominate the visual hierarchy over spectator actions
- No clear visual distinction between attended/not attended presentations

#### **D. Limited Context for Decision Making**
**Issue**: Spectators lack information to make informed rating decisions
- No indication of which presentations they've attended
- Abstract may not provide enough context for meaningful rating
- No reminder of when/where they saw the presentation

#### **E. Mobile Experience Gaps**
**Issue**: Mobile-first design could be improved for conference attendees
- Small touch targets for action buttons
- Information density may be overwhelming on small screens
- No consideration for one-handed operation during conference

## Recommended UI/UX Improvements
