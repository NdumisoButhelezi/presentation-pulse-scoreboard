# Presentation Pulse Scoreboard - Changes Log

## Scoring System Updates

### 1. Standardized to 25-Point Scale

- Changed the scoring system to consistently use a 25-point scale throughout the application
- Each judge can award up to 25 points per presentation
- Multiple judges' scores are now added together rather than averaged

### 2. Score Display Improvements

- Created a consistent `ScoreDisplay` component used across all views
- Scores now display in the format `X/Y` where:
  - X = Total points awarded
  - Y = Maximum possible points (25 × number of judges)
- Fixed inconsistencies between presentation cards and leaderboards

### 3. Components Updated

- **PresentationCard**: Now uses the standard `getJudgeTotal()` function for score calculation
- **VoteModal**: Updated to show a maximum score of 25 instead of 50
- **HallOfFame**: Now uses the ScoreDisplay component for consistent formatting
- **LeaderboardPage**: Updated to show scores with maximum possible values

### 4. Technical Implementation

- Added `maxPossibleScore` calculation (25 × judge count) to presentations
- Created reusable `ScoreDisplay` component to handle formatting
- Updated utility functions in `scoringConfig.ts` to use 25-point scale
- Made sure calculations are consistent across all pages

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Users can now easily see the actual score and potential maximum
2. **Consistency**: All UI components show scores in the same format
3. **Accuracy**: Judge total is correctly calculated as a sum rather than average
4. **Transparency**: The score display more clearly shows how many judges have voted
